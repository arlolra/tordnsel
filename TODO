# tordnsel wishlist for haskell hackers looking for a challenge

 - update for compatibility with ghc 7.4 or newer
 - make sure we are IPv6 compatible and safe
    - support ipv6 dns queries
    - support ipv6 tor exit relays
    - separate options to enable/disable ipv4 and ipv6 functionality
 - more input validation on dns queries
 - update the TorControl for the latest Tor 0.2.3.x torcontrol spec
 - don't trust the local running environment to be sane or safe
 - figure out some sort of packaging to make installation easier
 - implement check.torproject.org web functionality so an instance
 doesn't need to run haskell, python, apache, and wsgi scripts.
    - bonus if this is a simple json or api call for yes/no answers
    rather than an entire website.
