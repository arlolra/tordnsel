0.0.3 - 2007-04-27
  - Implement active testing through exit nodes to determine the IP address
    connections actually originate from. Store this information in state
    files so external scripts have access to it.

  - Always return an A record with the value 127.0.0.2 when queried about
    127.0.0.2. This conforms to the convention for testing DNSBLs.

  - Fix a bug that could kill the Tor controller thread when Tor is
    restarted. Tor closing the control connection created a race condition
    allowing an asynchronous exception to escape an exception handler and
    kill the Tor controller thread.

0.0.2 - 2007-04-14
  - Fix another bug caused by the incorrect Ord instance for PortNumber.
    We don't want to accept DNS queries from privileged ports so we can
    avoid a potential denial of service caused by an attacker spoofing our
    own IP address in the query.

0.0.1 - 2007-04-13
  - Ignore incoming descriptors with published times older than ones we
    already have.

  - Consider any router that has published a descriptor within the last 48
    hours to be running. This means we don't use network status info anymore,
    but we'll still keep track of it in case it becomes useful.

  - Set FetchUselessDescriptors so we receive descriptors for non-running
    routers.

  - Fix a bug caused by an erroneous Ord instance for PortNumber in
    Network.Socket. PortNumbers were being compared in host order even
    though they're stored in network order. This caused some queries to
    incorrectly match exit policy rules and others to miss matches.

0.0.0 - 2007-04-11
  - Initial release.
